This project shows my personal information. 

## Technical Achievements
- I use CSS to costumize the webpage. All CSS properties are in the `style` tag in `head`, which makes the code much more organized.
- Two images are shown on the page, allowing the visitor to get better visual impression. 
- A hyperlink to WPI homepage is shown as an `address` tag.
- A text area and a send button to send a message to me. But the actual functionality has not been implemented.
- An email link to send me an email. This will automatically open the default email app.




## Design Achievements

-   A gray paper-like background to make the page more eye-friendly.
-   Well-organized list in the page.
