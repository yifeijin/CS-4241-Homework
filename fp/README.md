`a4-All Nighter` team - deployed: https://fp-allnighter.herokuapp.com/

The web app keeps your relationship with someone you cares. Say if your girlfriend or boyfriend does something special or gives you a suprise, you can click the box on the right hand side. It will ask for the date, location and what happened and store it in the database.

One day you have a fight with her/him and want to break up with her/him, you can log in your account and click the left-hand-side box. It will randomly choose a message you put in before and show it to you. You will feel much happier at that moment and not be angry with him/her anymore!
