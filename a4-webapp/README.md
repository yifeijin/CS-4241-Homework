`a4-restaurant` team - deployed: https://a4-restaurant.herokuapp.com/

We created a restaurant webpage with reservation, menu, and a home page. The reservation page will interact with MongoDB. If the time has been booked, the button is disabled. Three days from today can be booked. Once the user selects the date, time slot will be shown on the right hand side with all the avaluable time. The search button is just for decoration purpose.


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Implemented Mongo DB to interact with data we have. This is a new cloud database that we have never used before. 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The selections on the navigation bar has hover effect powered by jquery. Every button in the reservation page also has a hover effect. 
- **Tech Achievement 3**: The color of the time slot blocks are determined by if they already existed in database in that paticularly selected date. Logical programming is included to achieve this part.
- **Tech Achievement 4**: Used external API: Bootstrap, to achieve both technical and visual effect. The effects work on buttons, input bars, and fonts.
- **Tech Achievement 5**: Included several dropdown lists. Some dropdown lists contain selectable values that can trigger the change in the other `<div>`. The changes work dynamically on the page without any action or refreshment. When choosing a date, the available time slots appear. When changing a date, the title that contains date information change dynamically.
- **Tech Achievement 6**: The 'Date' dropdown list updates everyday. It is determined by the date of the day it is opened. The selectable values are the dates three days from the day user open the website.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: We used a navigation bar on the top of the page. The color corresponses to the main page's picture. In the bottom of the main page, we have a introduction of the restaurant with a picture on the right hand side. The font and color of the text were carefully choosen. 
- **Design Achievement 2**: In the menu page, we used grid to show three food pictures and the menu on the top right corner. The whole menu page looks elegant and beautiful.
- **Design Achievement 3**: In the reservation page, we had a container in the middle include the form to send back to the backend. We used classic white/black to design this page.
