Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  

---

## Chinese Foodie

Summary:
The project pertains to list attributes of Chinese dishes, including their names, original city they came from, their spiciness, price, and price range. The goal of the web application is to introduce famous Chinese food to the world.
The main challenge of this project was to serve data in backend and send data frontend to backend and vice versa. The key innovations that made it possible to address the challenge was Ajax which was covered recently in class. It uses less code and clear logic for HTML to receive data and send back to server. The main results of the implementation addressed the challenge as it successfully get data from a JSON file and edit it from frontend. The possibly areas for future work is to store data in SQL server and add SQL commands to achieve better actions for queriing and updating data.
